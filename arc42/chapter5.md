# Quality Requirements

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with
scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in
section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important
to them, concrete and measurable.

See [Quality Requirements](https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/) in the
arc42 documentation.

## Quality Tree

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

The quality tree (as defined in ATAM â€“ Architecture Tradeoff Analysis
Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes
large number of quality requirements.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and
requirements:

-   tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or
    "usefulness" as a root

-   a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the
following section.

## Quality Scenarios

<div class="formalpara-title">

Three quality scenarios:

- Performance
    Scenario: A user wants to upload a picture under normal operations. The picture is uploaded within 2 Seconds.
  
- Recoverability
    Scenario: A user wants to edit a picture and the server closes. All changes are saved in time.

- Security
    Scenario: A user logs in with a different IP-address. The report is sent within 30 seconds.
