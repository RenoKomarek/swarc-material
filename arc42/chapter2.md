# Solution Strategy

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and
solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

-   technology decisions

-   decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g.
    usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern

-   decisions on how to achieve key quality goals

-   relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development
    process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are
the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation
rules.

**Form**

</div>

Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way, based upon
problem statement, quality goals and key constraints. Refer to details
in the following sections.

See [Solution Strategy](https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/) in the arc42
documentation.




Architecture Decisions
Contents

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented here in this central section or whether you better document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

Motivation

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

Form

Various options:

ADR (Documenting Architecture Decisions) for every important decision

List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:

more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

See Architecture Decisions in the arc42 documentation. There you will find links and examples about ADR.




# Risks and Technical Debts

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by
priority

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested
measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

See [Risks and Technical Debt](https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/) in
the arc42 documentation.
