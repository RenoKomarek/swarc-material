Solution Strategy
Contents

A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

technology decisions

decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern

decisions on how to achieve key quality goals

relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

Motivation

These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

Form

Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way, based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints. Refer to details in the following sections.

See Solution Strategy in the arc42 documentation.




Architecture Decisions
Contents

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented here in this central section or whether you better document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

Motivation

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

Form

Various options:

ADR (Documenting Architecture Decisions) for every important decision

List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:

more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

See Architecture Decisions in the arc42 documentation. There you will find links and examples about ADR.




Risks and Technical Debts
Contents

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

Motivation

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

Form

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

See Risks and Technical Debt in the arc42 documentation.
