# Solution Strategy

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

Image Editing and Sharing Service

-    Implement a custom image editing and sharing service.
    Utilize microservices to enable the easy addition of new filters and photo functions.
    Ensure professional image editing capabilities with extensibility.Develop and manage the service in-house.

Third-party Integration

-    Integrate cloud-based third-party software.
    Follow a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach.
    Seamlessly integrate with a partner's services while remaining open for third-party service integration.    
    Collaborate with a partner for plugin/microservice development.

User-generated Challenges and Competitions

-    Implement a microservice-based approach.
    Create a central challenge creation service and additional services for challenge validation.
    Facilitate user-generated challenges, competitions, and feeds.
    Maintain and develop the microservices for challenge management.

# Architecture Decisions

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

Maintenance of Microservices Architecture

- Despite performance concerns, we have opted to maintain our Microservices architecture. Microservices offer agility and flexibility, allowing us to respond quickly to evolving requirements and reducing the complexity associated with a monolithic architecture.

Implementation of a Control Service with AI Capabilities

-    We have chosen to create a "Control Service" with AI capabilities to enhance the management and control of our services. This decision enables us to leverage AI for intelligent decision-making and automation, contributing to more efficient operations.

Considering SOA for Performance Enhancement

-    In recognition of performance concerns associated with Microservices, we acknowledge the potential benefits of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in optimizing performance. As an international company with ample resources, we are open to exploring the transition to SOA to meet demanding performance requirements when necessary

**Motivation**

</div>

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace
your decisions.

# Risks and Technical Debts

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

1. Complexity
-    The increasing complexity of the architecture demands more resources for inter-service communication and the seamless integration of new services into the existing network. 

2. Data Management
-    The influx of inconsistent data poses challenges in terms of organization and distribution. Ensuring the consistency and accuracy of data across the system becomes a complex task. Failure to manage data effectively can lead to data quality issues, potentially impacting decision-making and system performance.

3. Security
-    Implementing security measures in each Microservice incurs significant costs. Additionally, securing sensitive data across multiple services is both cost and time-intensive.

**Motivation**

</div>

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.
